#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(1) because there's no "second layer" of looping needed, if you wanted to further loop then you'd raise the power exponentially by one -- constant time.


b)  O(n log(n)) is no looping within loop, just iterating j. This would cause J to double each iteration as well


c) O(n) there's a negative iterator which takes bunnies down it's base case without multiple manipulations

## Exercise II

I would approach this with the string split method binary search.  By splitting the floors in half and testing if the egg breaks you can quickly eliminate multiple floors that would cause the egg to break.  This is a O(n) operation I believe.
